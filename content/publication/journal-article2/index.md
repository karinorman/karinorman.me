abstract: Prioritizing regions for conservation is essential for effectively allocating limited conservation resources. One of the most common approaches to prioritization is identifying regions with the highest biodiversity, or hotspots, typically using global range map data. Range maps are readily available at large scales for an array of taxa, but are also known to differ from local-scale survey data in the same regions. We examined how prioritizations may differ between range map and survey data using the North American Breeding Bird survey (BBS) and BirdLife International range maps as a case study. Hotspot prioritizations were generated for species richness and the richness of rare species at two scales. Total species richness patterns differed substantially between data types with at most a 41% overlap in identified hotspots. Some regions had few or no hotspots for one data type and a significant number for the other. Hotspots for rare species were more similar across the data types with 44% overlap at the larger scale. Future efforts to prioritize areas for conservation should consider differences between local-scale survey data and range maps, match data to the scale of interest, and develop methods to better downscale range map-based prioritizations to the scale of conservation decisions.
